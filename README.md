# Boggle

This repository contains four branches, each a part of the whole Boggle game. The branches drop-down menu can be found above on the left by clicking "Branch: master".


Assignment-9: Front-end GUI and back-end logic. The logic uses a MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture that allows users to connect to the game via a REST API Service.
API Documentation Website: http://ice.eng.utah.edu/Help


Assignment-10: Custom built REST API that no longer relies on the url above. Created from scratch to be independent of the website. Designed and implemented the Boggle API using an ASP.NET Web Application Project (.NET Framework) running on IIS Express. This database is a "poor mans database" that uses static variables.


Assignment-11:  Designed and implemented a database using an SQL Server Database. Removed the static variables.


Assignment-12: Removed the dependency on the IIS Express web server and instead receives and sends back HTTP requests via sockets.
